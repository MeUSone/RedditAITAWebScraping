When solving the issues that you have presented, you need to mutually acknowledge and appreciate the efforts both of you have put in for bringing an income into the home. \\nThere are basic chores that need to be done on a daily basis or every few days, and those do need to be divided relative to job strain. However, you say you are very neat. If there are additional chores that he believes are unnecessary and strenuous, but you insist upon them, then try to reach a compromise where he does more of the daily chores whereas you would handle the more neat, obscure, neater chores (for example, I am very particular about the way I put away my daughters’ clothes into their dresser, so my husband will wash and dry their clothes and then I’m the one who folds it and puts it into their dresser because he is less particular than me in that regard, and this is just the way we balance that particular chore). \\nYou two genuinely need to communicate and learn to respect the strain that is going on in each other’s lives. Him more so than you, he needs to understand your work load that even though you are at home, that doesn’t mean you have time to handle everything, all day everyday. \\nIf you guys are able to handle this and make it more balanced to give both of you free time, you mentioned that you are different people from when you first married and dated. That’s fine. People change. Throughout life we have to relearn how to love our spouses. \\nTry to find a way to do things together. Try playing one of his games with him. Bring him into your hobbies. Find a way to combine them. Reignite the love, and oftentimes reigniting that love can bring more mutual respect and open communication. From the way it sounds, there are more issues than simply the chore load, But they’re common and easily fixed. I have faith you will be okay. \\nAlso this is not expert advice just someone in a marriage who has a little bit of experience in this regard.
