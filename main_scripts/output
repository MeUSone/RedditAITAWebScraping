It makes me feel like a 5 year old getting lectured about how to behave at restaurants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were going out this past Friday, and she was giving me the old pep talk.

That and, she lets me know how weird she thinks it looks if it\'s 6-8 couples and then her solo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat doesn\'t help is, on the train ride over from our apartment to these friends\' apartments, she\'ll say things like " Please talk to people, please don\'t just stand in the corner on your phone. Please come find me if you\'re struggling. Please try and enjoy it". It makes me feel like a 5 year old getting lectured about how to behave at restaurants. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were going out this past Friday, and she was giving me the old pep talk. I hadn\'t had a great day at work and I was on edge, so, I asked her to not lecture me, I know the routine. She said she was being helpful. I told her it\'s not helpful and that by talking down to me, it makes her come off like a bitch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got very upset that I was " swearing" at her. We didn\'t go out, I was forced, yes forced, to sleep on the couch. My view is, I don\'t like the same, tired " How are you going to behave" routine, and I wanted it stopped. Her view is I have no manners and clearly need to be taught how to address issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Back when they were in the end of 5th grade, my wife and I were planning to get them both phones over the summer as they would be starting 6th grade next year.\n\nUnfortunately COVID hit, and now that they would be home all day, my wife and I saw no reason to give them phones as they already had cellular iPad minis and were going to get laptops for school.\n\nFlash forward to to this school year, and my sons are both going to middle school after doing 6th grade virtual. They reminded us that we were going to get them phones once their school restarted, but my wife recently lost her job and found a much lower paying one, so we were trying to get our finances back on track.\n\nThey also haven’t been doing to well this year. Last quarter, they brought home report cards with Bs, Cs, and Fs. I was a bit disappointed and told them that I didn’t want to reward them with phones for a report card like that, and I would need As and Bs for a phone. \n\nI told them that I would work with them and get them a tutor, but they also needed to work had too. They had this quarter to work and earn their phone. I reminded them that if one of them ended up getting the grades required and the other one didn’t, I would only be buying a phone for the one who got the grades.\n\nOver the next two weeks I began to see major improvement from both bob and joe, however, as a few more weeks went by, I could see bob slacking off. My wife and I kept trying to get him motivated, but he just didn’t try.\n\nFlash forward to last week and I got their report cards back. Joe had been working like a machine for the past quarter and it really showed. He got all As-not one B. Bob on the other hand slipped back into the B and C range.\n\nI was tracking their progress on my phone throughout the quarter and during the last week, I went out and bought Joe’s iPhone 12 and kept it until that day. I knew at this point there was no way for bob to catch up(there were no quizzes scheduled for the week), but I went and bought a pair of AirPods for him after calling and asking my wife if it was okay with her.\n\nOn the day of the incident, I went to Joe and bobs room and handed them both their presents. I explained to bob that I did see him work hard the first week but then he did slack off. I also told him that if he was willing to try again next quarter I would happily buy him a phone too.\n\nIt’s been a week now since then, and bob has barely said a word to me, my wife, or joe. I don’t want bob to feel as though we chose joe over him, so I’m considering buying him the phone to make him feel better, but my wife thinks that since we gave them both the same choice, it was fair. I think I may be the asshole as this has driven a rift through the family - bob on one side and the rest of us on the other. \n\nSo, AITA for getting only one of my twin sons a phone?\n\nEdit: To everyone saying the phone is out of our budget, we had more than enough to buy the phone on contract so that part wasn’t a big deal.', 'scores_judgement_bot': {'YTA': 57, 'NTA': 36, 'ESH': 0, 'NAH': 2, 'INFO': 1, 'YWBTA': 0}, 'scores_custom': {'NTA': 83, 'YTA': 16, 'NAH': 0, 'INFO': 1, 'ESH': 0}, 'comments': [{'comment_id': 'hgkxk9d', 'comment_author': 'Dizzy_Barber_2281', 'comment_body': "YTA I think making phone ownership a reward for grades was a mistake as it is something your kid is going to need to have for social life and for safety.

Twin rivalry if very real and there will always be something that one twin is “better” at than the other. Theoretically this may have been a great idea if they were not twins but unfortunately twins sometimes have difficulty establishing their individuality this early on in life. I don’t know how similar the boys are but they will always be compared to each other which will create unhealthy competition. By awarding Joe the phone (rightfully so btw, he earned it) you’ve basically crowned him the better twin. Although this is not what you were trying to do Bob will not see it this way. Everyone learns differently and has different drives so it could be that Bob is having difficulty with the material or does not have the same self discipline that Joe has. I don’t think you should just give Bob the phone but you should to talk to him about how he’s feeling and maybe give him another incentive that will allow him to earn his phone at a quicker pace so he doesn’t feel left out for too long.\n\nAs a side note my twin sister and I both did well in school but I always did better (A student vs A/B student with a few Cs). At school it was popular knowledge that I was the “smart” one and she was the “cool/funny one.” We were both cool and smart but by school and adolescent standards she was  “cooler” and I was “smarter.” There were lots of things she was better at than me but she doesn’t recognize that because those aren’t the attributes that were praised in our family. The academic stuff really bothered her because at times she would be excluded from academic distinction ceremonies or if she was invited to a ceremony she would be ranked a distinction lower than me. She labels herself the “dumb” twin and assigns all her failures to the fact that she is the “dumb twin.” As an adult, she recently found out she has had undiagnosed ADHD which I think went undiagnosed for so long because of the pressure my parents put on her to strive for A’s.

You needed to make sure that what you were asking of each child was achievable for both of them and it doesn’t seem like you’ve done that.\n\nI’ll give an example about maths ability from my childhood. I came home one year with a B+ in maths, and my teachers’ comment for that semester was “Lilac talks too much in class and would have been able to achieve a much better grade if she had applied herself more. Her effort this semester was disappointing.” Or something along those lines, I don’t remember the comment word for word. Now, if I had the ability of a maths genius, then the grade and the fact I talked too much in class would indeed have been disappointing. To my mother however, who read this comment with the knowledge of my solid C- performance in maths since forever, the teacher looked like an idiot. Because the teacher didn’t know or care to know what I was ordinarily capable of achieving, she was disappointed in what was for me a stellar performance. And that didn’t feel great, being told my best grade ever was “disappointing”.\n\nThere was no way in hell I was ever going to get an A in maths. But my teacher expected it of me all the same. Had I not been very self-assured, the expectation placed on me to achieve that which was impossible would have been soul-crushing. And it would likely have lead to the same outcome you observed in bob. He tried really hard the first couple of weeks. But once he started getting results back he probably started to realise that in at least one subject he was never going to be able to get even a B. And because you attached this to all subjects rather than tailoring the improvements required to per subject per child, he gave up completely. Because what is the point in trying really hard if at the end of the day you still don’t achieve what you need to. It’s demoralising.\n\nOverall, I think the main issue is choosing to tie your rewards to outcomes rather than to effort. So soft YTA from me. I would suggest in future tailoring the reward to each child as well. If bob loves skateboards but joe doesn’t like them, but joe likes scooters and bob doesn’t, then these should be the rewards you choose. Because if bob doesn’t achieve enough to get the skateboard, he’s not going to be jealous of joe getting a scooter since he doesn’t like scooters. It removes the competitive nature of rewards (a little at least).

Back when they were in the end of 5th grade, my wife and I were planning to get them both phones over the summer as they would be starting 6th grade next year.\n\nUnfortunately COVID hit, and now that they would be home all day, my wife and I saw no reason to give them phones as they already had cellular iPad minis and were going to get laptops for school.\n\nFlash forward to to this school year, and my sons are both going to middle school after doing 6th grade virtual. They reminded us that we were going to get them phones once their school restarted, but my wife recently lost her job and found a much lower paying one, so we were trying to get our finances back on track.\n\nThey also haven’t been doing to well this year. Last quarter, they brought home report cards with Bs, Cs, and Fs. I was a bit disappointed and told them that I didn’t want to reward them with phones for a report card like that, and I would need As and Bs for a phone. \n\nI told them that I would work with them and get them a tutor, but they also needed to work had too. They had this quarter to work and earn their phone. I reminded them that if one of them ended up getting the grades required and the other one didn’t, I would only be buying a phone for the one who got the grades.\n\nOver the next two weeks I began to see major improvement from both bob and joe, however, as a few more weeks went by, I could see bob slacking off. My wife and I kept trying to get him motivated, but he just didn’t try.\n\nFlash forward to last week and I got their report cards back. Joe had been working like a machine for the past quarter and it really showed. He got all As-not one B. Bob on the other hand slipped back into the B and C range.\n\nI was tracking their progress on my phone throughout the quarter and during the last week, I went out and bought Joe’s iPhone 12 and kept it until that day. I knew at this point there was no way for bob to catch up(there were no quizzes scheduled for the week), but I went and bought a pair of AirPods for him after calling and asking my wife if it was okay with her.\n\nOn the day of the incident, I went to Joe and bobs room and handed them both their presents. I explained to bob that I did see him work hard the first week but then he did slack off. I also told him that if he was willing to try again next quarter I would happily buy him a phone too.\n\nIt’s been a week now since then, and bob has barely said a word to me, my wife, or joe. I don’t want bob to feel as though we chose joe over him, so I’m considering buying him the phone to make him feel better, but my wife thinks that since we gave them both the same choice, it was fair. I think I may be the asshole as this has driven a rift through the family - bob on one side and the rest of us on the other. \n\nSo, AITA for getting only one of my twin sons a phone?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You can't shirk your responsibilities in life and still get the benefits as if you were working hard. I think it's good of you to give him a second chance, because that's what parents are for, but make sure that if he really wants an iPhone 12, he puts in the work to get it.  \nOtherwise, you could compromise and get him a phone that isn't as expensive, as a reflection of how much work he put into getting his grades up.  \n\n\nLife is brutal and unfair, and when you're a kid it's the perfect time to be shielded from that, but (and now I'm moving heavily into opinion territory, so you can take this with a grain of salt), I believe that it's great for your kids (and healthy) to allow them to take responsibility for their actions and even give them opportunities to make money here and there so they get a better understanding of ownership and a greater sense of responsibility.

I think the part that was unfair was the gifts are severely disproportionate. An it should’ve been that if they get out of failing range they get a phone and then if you wanted to reward the all A’s you could get a new model or maybe the AirPods as a reward for success because there are cheap alternatives that fill the same functionality for Bob. But the way it was, the functionality of the gifts are too different. One kid now can text and have social opportunities the other doesn’t and that’ll breed resentment because stuff like this changes their socialization at school and how freely they can engage with their peers, especially in middle school when that stuff matters. \n\nI also generally don’t think school and grade based systems are great benchmarks for unrelated rewards at home beyond the falling/passing. Its an easy thing to default to but it’s not designed for all kids, reaching the same target doesn’t mean the same difficulty. I distinctly remember in high school a friend would spend hours trying to study everything for our history class and I didn’t but some shit just stuck in my brain and I did much better than her despite her efforts. I don’t think I deserve to be rewarded over her for lucking out that for whatever reason my recall was better and the teachers style worked for me.

( I believe there was an additional high price incentive like a weekend trip but I’m not too sure ) \n\nOP could never get all A’s there entire time in high school because they always got a lower grade in the REQUIRED language course. (a class that couldn’t be changed out). Which meant her parents took the other sibling for these rewards while excluding OP. \n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if she developed some type of complex because of it. Where she had a weird relationship with grades because it was obviously the only thing her parents cared about. Although after OP realized that she would never be able to do well in that one class and that her parents would never award her for her hard work in her other classes. She gave up on trying to meet their unrealistic expectations anyway. And stopped valuing their opinions. (sounds kind of familiar to Bob’s behavior) \n\nOP is approaching the time to graduate from college and her parents want to come to the graduation ( as expected ) and to celebrate with her. \n\nHowever there’s a negative response that I’m sure her parents never considered happening. OP doesn’t want to invite them. She doesn’t want to celebrate her collegiate academic achievements with people who her high school academic achievements weren’t enough. \nAnd I’m sure their long term relationship has also been affected by her parents obsession with A’s instead of whether their kids understood the material or did well in general. \n\nAnd I don’t blame her. Especially in the context of her just having one really bad class while doing well in the others. \n\nYou should think about that not only as you work to fix this situation but in all future decisions too. That when you make decisions like this, you should expect to apply them on a long term scale. Get A’s and B’s and you’ll get an reward. Not necessarily an iPhone every time but something nice. That’s the standard going forward for each child and Bob is being faced with the fact that he’ll never be able to meet those expectations so he’ll never get the rewards. \n\nYours boys are at an age where they’ll start to differ, academically, socially, emotionally etc. and having expectations of them without considering them as individuals and whether it’s in their capability  or interest will just hurt their relationship not only with you and your wife but with each other as well. Because odds are, your expectations will always favor one of them, which excludes the other without anyway for an alternative\n\nI don’t believe raising kids should be done in such a black and white way.

He feels dumb, he feels like hes the worse twin. Now he'll want to use the phone too and his brother will have to share it with him, but I don't care how old you are, there will be a power dynamic and his brother will use this against him and make him feel worse.\n\nSo great, he brother got a phone, his brother is using it to shame him more.  Now there's the anger at the parents, I imagine he thinks its bullshit that if he tried his best he got nothing, why try hard again? Its awfully painful to try hard for something, not get it, and have your brother who tries maybe less hard and he gets it. Shame again. \n\nSo now hes angry at his brother and family.
